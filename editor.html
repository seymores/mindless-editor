Why it didn’t work

Matrix management solved the wrong problem
It fixated on team autonomy
Collaboration was an assumed competency
Mythology became difficult to change

    Matrix management solved the wrong problem

    The “full stack” agile team worked well, but the matrix management of software engineers introduced more problems than it solved.
    
        Teams at Spotify were rather long-lived. The benefit of not having to change manager when moving to another team was limited.
    
        Engineering managers in this model had little responsibility beyond the career development of the people they managed. Even then, their ability to help with interpersonal people skills development was limited. An engineering manager would not manage enough of the other people on the team or be involved enough in the daily context to independently assess conflict within the team.
